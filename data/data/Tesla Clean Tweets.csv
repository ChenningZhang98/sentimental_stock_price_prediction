"""As a small-scale manufacturer with an outsized valuation and public image, Tesla may be especially vulnerable to threats created by escalating tension in the Sino-American relationship."" $TSLA $TSLAQ-Ft. @montana_skeptic -"
"8/ Musks China charm offensive may keep him, and thus Tesla, in Beijings good graces, but it may have unintended consequences elsewhere. The American media has been looking increasingly askance at Teslas Chinese dealings. $TSLA $TSLAQ-"
"7/ While Musks US citizenship renders him safe from the more heavy-handed tactics Beijing has lately deployed against domestic tech giants, he is clearly aware that the nature of power is very different in China than it is in the US and has acted accordingly. $TSLA $TSLAQ"
"2/ So what was the price of Teslas uniquely privileged status? Well, in exchange for generous subsidies & support for Giga Shanghai, Tesla agreed to be bound by a mesh of contractual obligations designed to leave it at the mercy of the CCP. $TSLA $TSLAQ-"
"13/ Teslas extreme vulnerability to Chinese interference, as well as its potential to be used as a political weapon in an escalating Sino-American confrontation, leave it exposed to a multitude of potentially lethal exogenous pressures. $TSLA $TSLAQ-"
"9/ For the many people, investors and disinterested citizens alike, who have come to see Teslas rise against all odds to take on the global auto industry as a kind of 21st century David vs. Goliath, such pro-China rhetoric may prove jarring. $TSLA $TSLAQ"
"10/ Worse still, Tesla risks being caught in the middle of a geopolitical crossfire. Its high public profile in both China and the US could make it a tempting target for retaliation, should the two powers seek to pressure one another economically or politically. $TSLA $TSLAQ"
"11/ Tesla could find itself made a political pawn in their larger game. China has the power to seize Teslas Shanghai factory virtually at will. Thus, even Musks kowtowing might not be enough to save Tesla from Beijing should international tensions escalate. $TSLA $TSLAQ"
"6/ Musk has also gone out of his way to praise the Chinese government & economic system, even comparing them favorably to those of the US. Twice in Jan. alone, he opined that, compared to the US government, the CCP was more responsible. $TSLA $TSLAQ-"
"5/ Compare that to Tesla's behavior in Feb. when it came under fire from a Chinese agencies, including the Administration for Market Regulation. Rather than ignore or mock, as they have been wont to do in the US, $TSLA instead issued an obsequious apology.-"
"1/ While many foreign observers took Teslas warm welcome as a sign of the companys value to China as an innovator and disruptor, others were not so sure. After all, the CCP does not grant special privileges or give favors for free. $TSLA $TSLAQ-"
"12/ This is no mere hypothetical or fanciful ""what if"" scenario. Indeed, some of Wall Streets leading analysts have woken up to the danger. Even Adam Jonas can see Teslas potentially perilous Chinese position. $TSLA $TSLAQ-"
"4/ For example, in 2018, Musk was forced to pay $20 million to settle a securities fraud suit with the SEC after he had lied publicly about plans to take Tesla private. The ink was barely dry on the settlement docs when he tweaked their noses. $TSLA $TSLAQ-"
"3/ Tesla is clearly aware of the power dynamics, as evidenced by its frequent kowtowing when criticized by Chinese officials and agencies. While Musk has become famous for thumbing his nose at US authorities, his demeanor has been completely different in China. $TSLA $TSLAQ"

"2/ Every first year finance student is taught the right way to value any asset is with discounted cash flow (DCF). For $TSLA even if you dont want to accept @elonmusk 50% volume growth assumption, assume EV adoption will grow from 3% in 2020 to 50% by 2030 (32% CGR)."

"@TSLA_Rex @unclecahir @facts_tesla @sachinvats @WallStCynic @elonmusk @zshahan3 @ResidentSponge Hey Buddy, About 10X, I was talking about longs with the example of NIO. I never said I shorted Tesla, I said if I had billions then only I would have shorted it. I cant afford Teslas put premiums anyway. But, if shorters dont short then how can we able to buy it at lower pric"
"@TSLA_Rex @unclecahir @facts_tesla @sachinvats @WallStCynic @elonmusk @zshahan3 @ResidentSponge More than 200-300%. For instance, with $SQ and $Z its more than 500-600%. But $SQ is good for both side plays, Buy call at support and buy put at resistance."
"@TSLA_Rex @unclecahir @facts_tesla @sachinvats @WallStCynic @elonmusk @zshahan3 @ResidentSponge Yes. 100x is myth and very very few people reached to 100x. We can achieve 10X. I got 18-20X with NIO. I bought NIO in last march at $2.4-2.5, started selling it from $45 and still holding few. I bought NIO instead of Tesla because it was cheap in terms of valuation."
"@garyblack00 @AdamGausepohl $FB is just behind $900 billion in market cap and they are earning 29 billion a year in net profits. When $MSFT hit 900 billion in market cap back in 2019, they were earning $39 billion in net profits. How much $TSLA was earning in Jan 2021?...$690 Million, barely positive"
"@TSLA_Rex @unclecahir @facts_tesla @sachinvats @WallStCynic @elonmusk @zshahan3 @ResidentSponge And you are correct about shorting its lousy idea. I dont say its disastrous because if they deserve to go down people should short it. Now, there are lots of stock having more than 500-1000 PE, for eg, CCIV reached $64 in Feb, doesnt it deserve to short?"
"@garyblack00 @AdamGausepohl When $TSLA hit $900 per share with 900 billion maker cap back in January 2021, I might call it as a single largest bubble in the history of capitalism. For eg, When $AAPL hit $860 billion in market cap in 2017, they were earning $48 billions in net profits."
"@TSLA_Rex @unclecahir @facts_tesla @sachinvats @WallStCynic @elonmusk @zshahan3 @ResidentSponge Anyway, I didnt had money to buy $TSLA last march, I just had bought merely 4-5 stocks and later I didnt have will to buy it looking at its valuation. But if it pullback below $300 in future. I will sell 75% of my portfolio and start buying $TSLA. Otherwise, I leave it."
"@garyblack00 @AdamGausepohl And $AAPL, $MSFT, $FB are also growth stocks if you want to say $TSLA is a growth stock having great potential earnings in the future."
"@garyblack00 @AdamGausepohl If $TSLA would have grown gradually I may have accepted it. Because it would have been align with the earnings and moderate PE. But sudden straight line in the graph of its stock after 10 years, it must cool off by some %."
"@TSLA_Rex @unclecahir @facts_tesla @sachinvats @WallStCynic @elonmusk @zshahan3 @ResidentSponge Yes, but we have to play the pullbacks for short term to generate some cash to invest in longs. It gives me immense joy when high flying stocks crashes by 40-50% from their current prices They deserves it."

"@Insurmountabl1 @garyblack00 If my thesis is correct, then this is possibly only the beginning.-Shorts diluted the float by up to 100m-150m TSLA shares.
